# Connect-and-Square

RULES OF THE GAME
- This is a 2-player game.
- The board is composed by a N x N sized dotted square (N is the size chosen by the players).
- In its turn, each player can connect two dots vertically  or horizontally that are 1 "dot-space" apart, which will draw a line connecting both dots selected.
- If the player is able to close a 1x1 square, that square gets filled with the player's color.
- The game ends when all 1x1 squares are filled.
- Wins the player with the most filled squares.
- In case both players have the same amount of colored squares, it's a tie (only possible on grids with even dimensions).
